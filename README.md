## Eco so extra, it’s Nova-level.

EcoNova is not just a project; it's a movement. Built with passion and urgency, EcoNova addresses the relentless tide of plastic pollution by reimagining how we educate and empower individuals to take sustainable actions. With a fresh approach that fuses technology, gamification, and storytelling, EcoNova bridges the gap between awareness and action, turning eco-friendly habits into a rewarding lifestyle.
EcoNova isn’t just about reducing plastic; it’s about creating a ripple effect that transforms communities, industries, and mindsets.
The spark for EcoNova came from a profound realization: the plastic we discard doesn’t just disappear—it lingers, harming ecosystems and communities. Watching documentaries and seeing heartbreaking visuals of plastic-clogged oceans and suffering wildlife motivated us to act. We wanted to create something impactful, approachable, and fun—a platform that makes sustainability not just a necessity but an exciting mission.

What sparked EcoNova was a single haunting question: What happens to the plastic we throw "away"? Spoiler: There is no "away." That realization led to countless brainstorming sessions, fueled by documentaries, heartbreaking visuals, and a shared desire to make environmentalism cool, accessible, and impactful.
